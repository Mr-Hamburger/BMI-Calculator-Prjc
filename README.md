# Body-Mass Index Calculator

My first Flutter project where I created an app as a learning project instructed by Santos Enoque on YouTube. From this project, I learned the basic concepts of creating a Flutter App, from creating classes to making widgets and implementing different widgets to build this app. 

Source codes are included in the 'lib' folder, learning notes are also taken as comments in the codes themselves. This was a great introductory project to Flutter and I am very excited to learn more about Flutter, Software Development, and potentionally pursuit a minor in Software Enginerring.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
