A Body-Mass Index Calculator I Created As My First Flutter Learning Project

This project was created from a design idea online and using the tutorial of Santos Enoque, a project based Flutter learning lesson. In this lesson, I built an app where users can input their height (In meters) and their weight (In kilograms) to calculate whether they are currently under, over, or in a good weight under the Body-Mass Index formula.

In this lesson, I've learned:
- Basic concepts of App Development
- Creating a Flutter dev environment for app development
- Many Flutter widgets and the usages of them such as Container, BoxDecoration, Text, GestureDetector
